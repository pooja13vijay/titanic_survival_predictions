Predict survival of passengers on titanic using logistic regression 

1. Visualise features in dataset using seaborn heatmap, countplot, distplot and boxplot. Determine features that has highest correlation with target, survival.
2. Impute the missing values in Age column with average age in each class.
3. Create dummy variables for categorical features.
4. Apply logistic regression on the predictors and target variables.
5. Get the predictions for the test set
6. Create classification report and confusion matrix based on the predictions and actual values.
